        <blockquote cite="Alan Watts"><p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q cite="his neighbors" class="neighbors">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</q> The farmer said, <q cite="the farmer" class="farmer">“<strong><strong>maybe</strong></strong>.”</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q cite="the neighbors" class="neighbors">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said, <q cite="the farmer" class="farmer">“<strong>maybe</strong>.”</q>

        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q cite="the neighbors" class="neighbors">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</q> and the farmer responded, <q cite="the farmer" class="farmer">“<strong>maybe</strong>.”</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q cite="the neighbors" class="neighbors">“Isn’t that great!”</q> Again, he said, <q cite="the farmer" class="farmer">“<strong>maybe</strong>.”</q>

        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <h3>good</h3> or <h4>bad</h4> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <h3>good</h3> fortune.

    <p>Conclusion</p>
    <blockquote><h3> Good </h3> and <h4>bad</h4> are just one perspective. Bananas are <h3>good</h3> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <h3>good</h3> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
